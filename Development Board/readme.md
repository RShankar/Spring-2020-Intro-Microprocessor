In this folder, you will see material related to the hardware aspects of the board. Included are the followinmg:

1. Microcontroller Reference Manual: A brief overview is found [here](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC16F18875). We have provided here the professional or complete version of PIC company's 'datasheet' for PIC16GF18875, the MCU (microcontroller unit) at the heart of the Curiosity HPC (Hign Pin Count) Development board. The datasheet is 674 pages long and covers a lot of material that is not relevant to this course. However, that is what is available to a practicing engineer and the enginer judiciously extracts what they need. So, do not be discouraged! The professor will tell you what material to focus on. Besides, all the assignments, lab work, and the exams will be open book, open notes, and open Internet, so there is no need to memorize anything.

2. Embedded Board Reference Manual: This is PIC company's handout on the Curiosity High Pin Count (HPC) Development Board.
