The MCU used is built to support C from bottom-up. This leads to efficient implementation of code written in the C programming language. Other MCUs require one to write code at the assembly language level (one level below the C language which is MCU dependent) to get efficient code. An embedded system should complete its  code in a time-efficient and power-efficient manner and turn down the clock rate and power so the embedded system can last a long time without the need for battery change. In newer application domains such as the IOT (Internet of Things), small stand-alone systems may be deployed in geographically remote and diverse areas and would be expected to communicate their surrounding information to higher nodes so some global information-driven intelligent decision can be taken. Examples might be irrigation needs of a golf course or a farm, fire threat or spread in a forest, and driving conditions of long stretches of icy roads. One can also visualize many needs in the sustainable energy environment, such as with windmills, ocean energy harvesting systems, etc. 

Support for C:

Power efficiency: use of lower clock rates and power down modes to save power. 

Scheduling activities: Use of interrupt driven systems

Interfacing with sensors and actuators:
