Text Book and our resources (required/recommended/useful):
* On the PIC Microcontroller (required):
   * PIC Microcontroller and Embedded Systems, using Assembly and C witth PIC18, 2nd edition, by Mazidi, Causey, and McKinlay, 2016
   * The book uses PIC18F, but our class development board uses PIC16F. There are similarities, allowing us to use it as the class
     text book. For differences, please use the online Microchip.com site reference  material. The professr will point out the
     differences.

     spring'20): https://github.com/RShankar/Intro-to-Microprocessors .     

Installation help and guides:
* Microchip video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8tRqvkFZcw
* Our IDE Installation (step-by-step). It is for an earlier version for a different board, but still useful:
      https://github.com/RShankar/Intro-to-Microprocessors/tree/master/MPLab%20X%20IDE
* HPC board connection to PC: https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/268/40001856A-967754.pdf
* Software to be downloaded and installed or to be explored: 
    * For stand-alone IDE (Operating system dependent) installation: https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide
    * Explore the IDE on the cloud (for learning purposes only; all class work must be done on the stand-alone IDE installed on your
      PC): https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-xpress
    * Explore application examples (this may show an empty list for a mminute or longer. Be patient and try a few clicks to get going. 
      Once you see a list, choose the 'Board' as Microchip Curiosity HPC and the 'Device' as PIC16F18875. You should see 10 of 15
      examples, which can be run on the cloud IDE or downloaded to be run on your stand-alone IDE later):
